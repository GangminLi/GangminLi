Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll

GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "GitHub's products."

Anyone with read permissions for a repository can test a GitHub Pages site locally.

Prerequisites
Before you can use Jekyll to test a site, you must:

Install Jekyll.
Create a Jekyll site. For more information, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll."
We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler:

Install Ruby. For more information, see "Installing Ruby" in the Ruby documentation.
Install Bundler. For more information, see "Bundler."
Building your site locally
Open Git Bash.
Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information about publishing sources, see "About GitHub Pages."
Run bundle install.
Run your Jekyll site locally.
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
> Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
>            Source: /Users/octocat/my-site
>       Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site
> Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
>      Generating...
>                    done in 0.309 seconds.
> Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site'
> Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
>    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
>  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
To preview your site, in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000.
Note: If you are using Ruby 3.0 and Jekyll 4.2.x or older, you will need to add the webrick gem to your project's Gemfile prior to running bundle install.

Updating the GitHub Pages gem
Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

Open Git Bash.
Update the github-pages gem.
If you installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages.
If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages.
