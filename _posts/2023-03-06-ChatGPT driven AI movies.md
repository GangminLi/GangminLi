# Introduction

ChatGPT the most disruptive Artificial Intelligence and the powerful tool on the internet has stomed the world. ChatGPT has revolutionized the way we interact with AI models. With its advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, ChatGPT has opened up new avenues for communication, learning, and creativity. 

It has paved the way for more intelligent products like virtual assistants, personalized language tutoring, and even automated content creation. 

You may have seen headlines about chatGPT being able to replace jobs and write documents and emails and answer questions and the list goes on and on. You also see many YoutTube channels talking about how to make money or create movies using chatGPT related AI models.

I have gone to try it out myself and with a creation of a movie for our University Opne Day. ChatGPT and a few other AI based models together provide an efficient and user-friendly way to create engaging avatar animations. I cna do it and I am sure anyone can create a high-quality, personalized video too.


# Here are the end products
  - [Movie generated with latest AI models For Oen Day: IT course Introduction ![Open day It course introduction movie](/assets/images/141152.jpg)](https://share.descript.com/view/OA3bC2ahp32)


  - [Movie of Prompt Eninggering  ![Prompt Engineering movie](/assets/images/203119.jpg)](https://share.descript.com/view/rnrkop3iv67) 
 

# Steps to creatre an animated avatar movie
Here are the procedures and the steps you need to take.
## Step 1: Create your movie script
I create my script using CharGPT. It may need multiple rounds of correction, clarification, and formulation.
I start simply tell chatGPT as “I am going to deliver an introduction to potential UG students. Can you outline a speech that include brief introduction of Information Technology course and our offers.”


ChatGPT comes up with a pretty detailed draft like this one.
![Prompt Engineering movie](/assets/posts/movies/164752.jpg)
and there are other 4 points including: 
- Overview of Information Technology Course
  - Provide a brief overview of the Information Technology course, explaining what it is and what it covers.
  - Highlight the importance of IT in today's world and the demand for skilled IT professionals.
- Course Offerings
  - Outline the various offerings and opportunities available to students in the IT course.
  - Mention the core courses that students will take, such as programming, database management, and cybersecurity.
  - Highlight any specializations or concentrations available within the IT program, such as web development or artificial intelligence.
  - Discuss any extracurricular activities or clubs related to IT, such as hackathons or coding clubs.
- Benefits of Studying Information Technology
  - Discuss the benefits of studying IT, such as high demand for skilled IT professionals, competitive salaries, and opportunities for growth and advancement.
  - Emphasize the versatility of an IT degree, as it can be applied to various industries and fields.
- Admissions and Application Process
  - Provide information about the admissions and application process, including any requirements or prerequisites.
  - Highlight any important dates or deadlines, such as application deadlines and orientation dates.
  - Explain any scholarships or financial aid options available to students.

It is complete but much information unnecessary since they are available on the university website and surly the students have read them already. I thought the import point is to give them a chance to taste what is like to be a IT student and how a lecture and a practical sessions are conducted.
Therefore, I ask ChatGPT to get ride of the info available on the website and add session taste in. … After a few rounds of discussion. I am happy with the final scripts.

## Step 2: Choose or create the Avatar
Avatar is important it can represents you or your department and your university. 

The tool I used is called "midjurney". It is a powerful but tricky tool to use if you dont knwo prompt. It has a commend called imagine. It takes natural language like prompts and a photo as input. It can generate amazing avatarseb

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            . Again, you need to learn how to use it and how to issue proper prompts. It takes many trail 

## Step 2: Record Your Audio
Once you have chosen your avatar, it's time to record the audio for your video. You can use a microphone to record your voice or upload pre-recorded audio. ChatGPT's advanced language processing abilities allow it to understand and transcribe your voice, making it easy to create engaging content.

## Step 3: Choose Your Background
ChatGPT offers a wide range of background options to add to your video. You can choose from a selection of pre-made backgrounds or create your own custom background using your own images or videos.

## Step 4: Animate Your Avatar
Now it's time to animate your avatar! ChatGPT's animation tools make it easy to create lifelike movements and expressions for your avatar. You can choose from a variety of pre-made animations or create your own custom animations to give your video a personal touch.

## Step 5: Finalize Your Video
Once you have finished animating your avatar, it's time to finalize your video. You can preview your video and make any necessary adjustments before exporting it as a high-quality video file. You can then share your video on social media, your website, or use it in your digital marketing campaigns.

From creating original stories to doing intricate text analysis, GPT-3 can do it all. Because they can accomplish so many things, you must be specific in your instructions. A excellent prompt generally relies on showing rather than telling. 

Prompt creation follows three main guidelines:

- **Show and tell:** Make your intentions obvious by using instructions, examples, or a combination of the two. If you want the model to rank a list of items in alphabetical order or to classify a paragraph by sentiment, show it that's what you want.

- **Provide quality data:** Make sure there are enough samples if you’re trying to develop a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern.  The model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response.

- **Check your settings:** The top_p and temperature settings determine how predictable the model is in providing a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're "cleverness" or "creativity" controls.

## Prompt engineering use GPT3 playground
Let su use GPT3 playground to show how prompt engineeering can be done for text classification task. 
**Prompt**

``` 
TThe following is a list of persons. tell me what are they famous in:
Aamir khan, Elon musk, Virat Kohli, Rahul gandhi, Andrey kurkov, yaoming, Chritan Ronaldo

Aamir Khan - Actor
Elon Musk - Entrepreneur
Virat Kohli - Cricketer
Rahul Gandhi - Politician
Andrey Kurkov - Author
Yaoming - Basketball Player
Cristiano Ronaldo - Football Player

```
It's worth noticing the features in this example:
Use plain language to describe your inputs and outputs. We use plain language for the input "list of persons" and the expected output "they famous in" As a best practice, start with plain language descriptions. While you can often use shorthand or keys to indicate the input and output, it's best to start by being as descriptive as possible and then working backwards to remove extra words and see if performance stays consistent. This is the perfect example of zero-shot classification. That is system is classifying the names based on its own trained world knowledge. We are not providing any sample examples to train the system.

let us see example of few-shot learning.  We need to extract some entities from a passage. So we are feeding some examples to the system and training the system to learn from those few examples. The ### token is used to differentiate between different training examples. Finally, the testing sentence will be given and the system will be able to extract the entities from the text. We can modify/alter the outputs by changing the configurations like temperature, Top p..etc showing at the right side panel of the window.

## Build your own prompt engineering platform
We can try to do prompt engineering use openA API. A convinient way is use OpenAI Python Library.  The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API.

here are the basic steps:

- Signup into the openAI platform to get an API key.
- Use openAI python wrapper library
- setup environment parameters
- add your training data 
- Call OpenAI API 

## Summary
From creating original stories to doing intricate text analysis, openAI GPT-3 can do it all. Because they can accomplish so many things, you must be specific in your instructions. Various NLP tasks such as text classification, text summarization, sentence completion, etc can be done using GPT-3 by prompting. An excellent prompt generally relies on showing rather than telling. 

Prompt creation follows three main guidelines:

**Show and tell, Provide Quality data,** and **Change settings.** 

Along with that, we can get the outputs in three ways

- Zero-shot learning: Where no examples are given for training.

- One-shot learning: Here only one example is provided for the training purpose

- Few-shot learning: Where we can provide a few examples to train the model along with the prompt.

GPT-3 is not open source yet and is only available via the openAI API. Here some examples in the GPT-3 basic playground terminal which is provided on the openAI website, rather than any programming language wrapper of openAI are illustrated. GPT-3.as a single model can perform multiple types of Natural Language Processing jobs.
